# Long-Running Tasks Lab

## Objectives

1. Create a long-running task
2. Upload and process a CSV file to create songs

## Overview

In this lab, we're going to augment the song library so that we can 
upload a CSV of songs and artists to expand our collection.

You will find a CSV of classic rock songs and artists in `db\songs.csv`. Use it 
to test your work!

## Instructions

1. Update the songs index view to allow a user to upload a CSV file of songs with 
artist names
2. Implement the `songs_controller#upload` action, which should create `Song` and 
`Artist` records from the CSV and redirect to the songs index page
3. Make sure all tests pass!

**Note** We're editing an existing application with some intentionally passing tests.
